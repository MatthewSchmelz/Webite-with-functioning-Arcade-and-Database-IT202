Afterwards: Hopfully all of the final demos aren't wearing you down too much, I tried to make mine not that long, but it also came out to the half hour mark, I'm not exactly the best at explaining how my code works, especially when I'm explaining my own code, but hopfully you were able to follow along. I think I did a decent job at explaining? Milestone 3 was a little rough and I hope my explaination for the final function is sufficent enough. Thanks for all the help during office hours, have a good break.
